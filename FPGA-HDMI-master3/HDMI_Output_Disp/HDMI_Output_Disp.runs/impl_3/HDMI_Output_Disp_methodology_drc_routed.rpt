TIMING-2#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock video_pll_inst/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate pin video_pll_inst/inst/clk_in1. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#2 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock video_pll_inst/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#3 Warning

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_video_pll and hdmi_disp_inst/U0/PixelClk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware.

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks

Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock hdmi_disp_inst/U0/PixelClk is created on an inappropriate internal pin hdmi_disp_inst/U0/PixelClk. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ *SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '2' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
